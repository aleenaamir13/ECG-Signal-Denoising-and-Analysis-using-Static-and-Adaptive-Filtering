# ECG-Signal-Denoising-and-Analysis-using-Static-and-Adaptive-Filtering
This project focuses on ECG signal denoising and analysis using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The goal is to simulate common ECG noises, apply static filters (IIR elliptic) and adaptive filters (LMS), and compare their performance using SNR, RMSE, and R-peak detection accuracy.
